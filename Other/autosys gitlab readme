## Adding or Modifying Jobs

To add or modify jobs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Make sure you have Git installed and clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Correct Environment**: 
   Choose the appropriate folder (ILD, IUT, or IL2) based on the environment you are working in.

3. **Edit the `jobs.jil` File**:
   - Use a text editor to modify or create job definitions in the `jobs.jil` file for the specified environment.
   - Follow the Autosys syntax and conventions for defining jobs to ensure correctness.

4. **Edit the `variables.jil` File**:
   - Similar to the `jobs.jil` file, modify or add necessary variables in the `variables.jil` file.

5. **Push Your Changes**:

6. **Create a Merge Request**: 
   Go to the GitLab UI and create a Merge Request for your changes. Ensure that reviewers understand the changes you're proposing.

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Build and Nexus Upload**:
   - Each time a commit is pushed to a branch, the CI/CD pipeline needs to be triggered by creating a versioned TAG:( ex: 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT or 1.0.1 )
   - Once the TAG pipeline completes successfully, it will create an artifact named `Autosys.xxx.zip`, which contains the `.jil` files for the specific environments.
   - The artifact will be pushed to the Nexus designated environment based on the TAG version.(Snapshot or Release)

3. **Deployment**:
   - The Nexus artifact will be added in the UBS Deploy Release page and pushed to specific environments.
